    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bistek Tagalog is a type of Filipino beef stew. This is also known as Beefsteak to some people. It is comprised of thin slices of beef and a generous amount of onions. These are stewed in a soy sauce and lemon juice mixture until the beef gets very tender. It is best enjoyed with warm rice. </p>
    <p>Easily one of the richest, most flavorful types of meat to choose from, beef is one source of protein that can truly shine in any handaan or celebration with an array of dishes. This is why, Filipinos, also love to integrate this filling red meat into our dishes. While it is versatile in working well with many other ingredients, it can also stand great on its own with few other components to support it. Our recipe today, a fan favorite called Bistek, is a fantastic example of this. </p>
