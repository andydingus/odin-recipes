    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sizzling Chicken Sisig is the chicken version of the popular sisig dish. This recipe is quick and easy and can be low in fat depending on the type and amount of mayonnaise that will be used.</p>
    <p>Sisig is known to be a fatty dish because it usually uses fatty parts of the pig such as the ears and face; the original recipe also uses the brain of the pig as a binder. Chicken sisig, on the other hand, can be considered as a healthier alternative because chicken meat has lesser fat. This recipe in particular makes uses of skinless chicken breast; it is low in fat and high in protein.</p>
